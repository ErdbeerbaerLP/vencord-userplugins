# RemoteAPI
Control your discord client with HTTP requests!

This plugin is experimental and might break under circumstances.

It also uses non-ideal ways to communicate with the backend, *THIS **WILL** SPAM YOUR DEVTOOLS WHILE ENABLED!*

## Use Cases
- **Streamdeck on Linux**
\
Use Discord with your streamdeck on linux, using one of the many streamdeck tools like [streamdeck-linux-gui](https://github.com/streamdeck-linux-gui/streamdeck-linux-gui) or [StreamController](https://github.com/StreamController/StreamController)
- **Automation**
\
Automate some actions using scripts. Be aware that spamming the API is never a good idea! I take no responsibilities if misused!
- **Integration into other tools**
\
Of course this can also be used with other tools as well!
